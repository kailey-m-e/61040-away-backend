# Assignment 4b: Design Summary

While creating my frontend, my backend mostly stayed consistent. The one change I made was to add additional queries to the Friending concept: while there was previously a getIncomingRequests query, there was no way for the frontend to see all of a user's outgoing friend requests or to see all of a user's current friends. This proved to be an issue for the Friends page, on which a set of usernames for each status (incoming, outgoing, and friends) was supposed to be displayed. Thus, I added the getOutgoingRequests and getFriends queries to return arrays of user ID's. Besides that, my concepts didn't change, and while the frontend allowed for some additional functionality (such as posting stats), this didn't require any updates to the backend.
