# Wishlist Concept Design Reflection

I made some significant changes to the Wishlist concept compared to assignment 2. First, I decided to remove the AI-augmented recommendation action for now in order to focus on creating a working backend. (While this does simplify the Wishlist concept, the ability to flesh it out by adding Gemini support still remains.)

Additionally, after coding an implementation of my original spec, I realized that the state structure wasn't very functional: I initially had a set of Wishlists, each with a set of userPlaces, and then a separate set of Places. However, while thinking through the user journey, I ran into a series of design decisions that I hadn't originally thought of: when was a place created? What happened when a user removed a place? Could duplicate places exist? I wasn't satisfied with the possible answers, so I realized that I could simply focus on defining places themselves instead of wishlists. Thus, I restructured the state accordingly, which led to a far more straightforward implementation.
