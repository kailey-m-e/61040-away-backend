- decided that I need place to have a database on its own and export it to the othre (doesn't matter if exports to postcard or postcard exports to it) because otherwise no way to get past places; can eventually add where creating a place uses an llm call to decide if the places actually exists or looks in some other database idk


- would it be good to have a clear option for wishlist?
- decided that i want to pass in the user in order to ensure that only the user can update the wishlist


- decided to refactor the states because a wishlist was a weird concept that didn't provide functionality -- now just looking at palces; multiple users can have same place
- decided to do no ai


- wishlist concept very simplified without AI - but will add back in later; still separate from posting becasue separate feed, simpler, etc.
