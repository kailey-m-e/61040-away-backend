# Wishlist Concept Spec

**concept** Wishlist \[User]

**purpose** to keep track of a user's future dream destinations

**principle** after a wishlist is created for a user, the user can add places that they want to travel to, and then remove places that they've already been or no longer want to go; an LLM recommends additional wishlist destinations to the user based off of places in their current wishlist, which can then be accepted or rejected by the user (\*not implemented in this assignment)

**state**

  a set of Wishlists with \
    a creator User \
    a userPlaces set of Places \\

  a set of Places with \
    a city string \
    a region string \
    a country string

**actions**

    **effects** creates and returns a new wishlist with the given creator

  addPlace(user: User, wishlist: Wishlist, city: string, region: string, country: string): (place: Place) \
    **requires** wishlist exists and user is its creator; place with the given city, region, and country doesn't exist in wishlist's set of userPlaces \
    **effects** creates a place with the given city, region, and country, adds the place to wishlist's set of userPlaces, and returns the place

  removePlace(user: User, wishlist: Wishlist, place: Place) \
    **requires** wishlist exists and user is its creator; given place exists in wishlist's set of userPlaces \
