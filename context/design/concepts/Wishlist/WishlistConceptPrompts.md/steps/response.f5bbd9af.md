# response:

The Deno test runner already provides visual indicators (green checkmarks for passing tests, red X's for failing tests) by default when tests are executed in a terminal that supports ANSI escape codes. You do not need to manually add `console.log` statements for these symbols within your test functions, as Deno handles this reporting automatically.

If you are not seeing these symbols, it might be due to:

* **Your terminal or environment:** Some environments or CI/CD pipelines might strip ANSI escape codes, leading to plain text output.
* **Deno version:** Ensure you are using a recent version of Deno.

Modifying the test file to manually print these symbols would be redundant and generally not a recommended practice for unit testing, as it bypasses the test runner's native reporting capabilities. The current tests are already structured correctly to leverage Deno's built-in pass/fail reporting.

Therefore, no changes are needed or recommended for the `WishlistConcept.test.ts` file to achieve this behavior. Deno should provide it out of the box.
