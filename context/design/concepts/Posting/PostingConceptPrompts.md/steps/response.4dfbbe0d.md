# response:

Here's a concise list of feedback and necessary fixes for the provided test cases:

1. **`PostingConcept.ts::create` Method Bug:** The `create` method in the `PostingConcept.ts` file still contains a bug in its date validation logic. The condition `end > start` should be `end < start` to correctly validate that the `end` date is *not before* the `start` date. (The `editDates` method has the correct logic).

2. **Test Cases 1, 2, 5: `create` Uses Future Dates, Violating Spec `requires`:**
   * The `create` action explicitly `requires` "end date is in the past".
   * Test Cases 1, 2, and 5 call `create` with `start` and `end` dates set to `new Date(2025, ...)` or `new Date(2026, ...)` which are in the future.
   * These tests should either:
     * Adjust the dates to be in the past to comply with the `requires` condition for successful creation.
     * Or, if testing invalid input, assert that `create` returns an error for these future dates (similar to Test Case 6's intent).

3. **Test Cases 1 & 2: Missing `effects` Verification for Edit Actions:**
   * `editTitle`, `editDates`, `editDescription`, `editPlace` actions in these test cases only assert that no error was returned.
   * They **must also query the state** (e.g., call `_getPosts` and inspect the returned `PostDoc` objects) to explicitly verify that the corresponding fields (`title`, `city`, `region`, `country`, `start`, `end`, `description`) were actually updated in the database as per the `effects` in the spec.

4. **Test Case 3: Incorrect Post ID for "Not Creator" Check:**
   * When `creatorB` attempts to edit/delete `creatorA`'s post, `nonPost` is currently used as the `post` ID.
   * This tests the "post not found" error instead of specifically "user is not its creator".
   * **Fix:** Obtain the `post` ID returned from `creatorA`'s successful `create` call and use *that specific ID* for `creatorB`'s edit/delete attempts to correctly test the "not creator" `requires` condition.

5. **Test Case 6: Incomplete Coverage for `create` Invalid Dates:**
   * This test aims to cover invalid dates but does not fully expose the `end < start` bug in the `create` method.
   * The second invalid `create` call (`end: new Date(2026, 8, 14)` for `start: new Date(2026, 9, 14)`) currently fails because `end > new Date()` (it's in the future), not specifically because `end < start` when both dates are in the past.
   * **Fix:** Add a new test scenario where `start` and `end` dates are *both in the past*, but `end < start`. This specific scenario will reveal the bug in `PostingConcept.ts::create`.
