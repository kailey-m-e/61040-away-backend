# response:

Based on the re-evaluation, only one critical issue needs to be addressed:

1. **Critical Issue: `create` action - Incorrect Date Validation Logic**
   * **Problem:** The `create` method's date validation `if (end.getMinutes > start.getMinutes || end.getMinutes > new Date().getMinutes)` incorrectly compares only the *minute components* of the `Date` objects. This fails to correctly enforce the `requires` condition that "end date is in the past and not before start date" for the full date/time.
   * **Correction Needed:** The comparison should use the full `Date` objects (e.g., `end.getTime() > new Date().getTime() || end.getTime() < start.getTime()`) or directly compare `Date` objects as they are comparable in JavaScript (`end > new Date() || end < start`).

The `_getPosts` sort order is **not an issue** because the implementation (`sort({ start: -1 })`) correctly matches the specification's explicit requirement to return posts "with the most recent post first."
