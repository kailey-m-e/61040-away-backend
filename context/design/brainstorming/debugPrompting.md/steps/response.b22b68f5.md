# response:

Okay, that's excellent! The `deno.json` content you provided confirms that you have correctly set up the `imports` map for your custom aliases:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "@concepts/": "./src/concepts/",
    "@utils/": "./src/utils/"
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Deno (and the Deno language server that powers your IDE's IntelliSense) exactly where to find modules imported with `@concepts/` and `@utils/`.

Given this, the red underlines for `@utils/types.ts` and `@utils/database.ts` should theoretically be resolved, and `npm:mongodb` should also be better understood by your IDE.

If they are *still* underlined, here are the most common reasons and troubleshooting steps:

### 1. For `@utils/types.ts` and `@utils/database.ts`:

* **Confirm File Paths:** The `deno.json` maps `@utils/` to `./src/utils/`. This means your `types.ts` and `database.ts` files **must** be located at `/src/utils/types.ts` and `/src/utils/database.ts` respectively, relative to your project root (where `deno.json` is).
  * **Is this path correct?** If your utility files are, for example, directly in `utils/` (i.e., `./utils/`), then your `deno.json` should be `"@utils/": "./utils/"`.
  * **Are there any typos** in `types.ts`, `database.ts`, or the import statements?
* **IDE Restart & Deno Extension:**
  * **Crucial Step:** Fully **restart your IDE** (e.g., close and re-open VS Code). The Deno language server needs to re-initialize and read the new `deno.json` file.
  * Ensure the **Deno VS Code extension** is installed and enabled for your workspace. Look for a "Deno" indicator in the status bar at the bottom of VS Code.
  * Sometimes, if the Deno extension is running into issues, you can try `Deno: Reload Import Registries` or `Deno: Restart Language Server` from the VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).

### 2. For `npm:mongodb`:

* **Deno Cache:** Deno downloads and caches npm packages. If `npm:mongodb` hasn't been cached yet, your IDE might not have its type definitions.
  * Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    deno cache npm:mongodb
    ```
  * After the cache completes, **restart your IDE** again.
* **IDE Restart & Deno Extension:** Same as above. The presence of `deno.json` helps the Deno language server to function correctly, but it still needs to load and process the npm types.

### 3. Exact Error Messages:

If the issues persist after trying the above, please provide the **exact error messages** that your IDE shows when you hover over the red underlined imports. This information is invaluable for pinpointing the specific problem.

***

**Summary of next steps for you:**

1. **Verify the `src/utils/` path:** Are `types.ts` and `database.ts` truly inside `your-project-root/src/utils/`?
2. **Restart your IDE.**
3. **Run `deno cache npm:mongodb`** in your terminal.
4. If still failing, **provide the exact error messages** for each underlined import.
