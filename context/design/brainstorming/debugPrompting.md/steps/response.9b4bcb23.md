# response:

Ah, this is a crucial piece of information! **No `tsconfig.json` and the use of `npm:mongodb` immediately tells me we're dealing with a Deno project, not a standard Node.js/TypeScript setup.** My previous response, based on the assumption of `tsconfig.json`, was incorrect for your context. My apologies for that initial misdirection!

In Deno, module resolution works differently, and custom path aliases like `@utils/types.ts` are handled by `deno.json` (or `deno.jsonc`), not `tsconfig.json`.

Here's why your imports are failing and how to fix them in a Deno project:

### The Problem Explained:

1. **`@utils/types.ts` and `@utils/database.ts`:**
   * These are custom module specifiers (aliases). Deno, by default, expects either:
     * **Relative paths:** `./path/to/file.ts` or `../path/to/file.ts`
     * **Absolute paths:** `/path/to/file.ts` (less common)
     * **Full URLs:** `https://deno.land/x/module@version/mod.ts`
     * **`npm:` specifiers:** For Node.js packages (which Deno handles specially).
   * Without a `deno.json` file configuring an `imports` map, Deno (and your IDE with the Deno extension) doesn't know what `@utils/` refers to. It's essentially a "magic" path that needs a definition.

2. **`npm:mongodb`:**
   * This syntax is perfectly valid for Deno and is how you import Node.js compatible npm packages. Deno automatically resolves, downloads, and caches these packages in your `DENO_DIR`.
   * **However, for your IDE (like VS Code with the Deno extension) to *properly* type-check and provide IntelliSense for these, it often benefits from a `deno.json` file being present, even if it's empty, or by explicitly running `deno cache npm:mongodb` once.** Sometimes, the IDE might need a restart or a `deno reload` command. The lack of `deno.json` might be contributing to the IDE's confusion here.

### The Solution: Create a `deno.json` (or `deno.jsonc`) file

You need to create a `deno.json` (or `deno.jsonc`) file in your project's root directory to define how Deno should resolve your `@utils` aliases.

**Ddbug Questions (Revised for Deno):**

1. **File Paths for `@utils`:**
   * Where are your `types.ts` and `database.ts` files located relative to your project root? (e.g., `src/utils/types.ts`, `app/utils/types.ts`, or just `utils/types.ts`?)
   * Knowing this is crucial for setting up the `deno.json` correctly. Let's assume for now they are in `src/utils/`.

2. **Deno Version:**
   * What Deno version are you using? (`deno --version`) - This helps ensure compatibility with `deno.json` features.

***

### Proposed `deno.json` Configuration:

Based on the assumption that your utility files are in `src/utils/`, here's how you'd configure `deno.json`:

1. **Create `deno.json` (or `deno.jsonc`) in your project root.**

2. **Add the `imports` map:**

   ```json
   // deno.json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       // You might still want a compilerOptions block for TS configuration,
       // even if it's empty or just inherits defaults.
       // Deno uses this similarly to tsconfig.json for type-checking.
       "lib": ["deno.ns", "deno.window"], // Or "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "deno.ns"] if not a browser project
       "strict": true
     },
     "imports": {
       "@utils/": "./src/utils/" // This maps "@utils/" to your actual source directory
     }
     // You might also add "tasks" here for Deno's task runner,
     // or "fmt" options for formatting, etc.
   }
   ```

   **Explanation of `imports`:**

   * `"@utils/"`: This is the alias prefix you're using in your import statements.
   * `"./src/utils/"`: This is the actual path, relative to your `deno.json` file, where Deno should look for modules when it sees `@utils/`.
   * So, `@utils/types.ts` will resolve to `./src/utils/types.ts`.

After creating and saving this `deno.json` file:

1. **Restart your IDE** (e.g., VS Code).
2. Ensure the **Deno extension** is installed and enabled for your workspace.
3. The red underlines for `@utils/types.ts` and `@utils/database.ts` should disappear.
4. For `npm:mongodb`, if the red underline persists, try running `deno cache npm:mongodb` in your terminal, then restarting your IDE again. The presence of `deno.json` usually helps the Deno extension properly analyze npm imports.

Let me know if your `types.ts` and `database.ts` files are in a different location than `src/utils/`, and I can adjust the `deno.json` example accordingly.

\#prompt: I have a deno.json here: [@deno.json](/../../deno.json)
