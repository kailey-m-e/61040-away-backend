# response:

Thank you for providing the location of your `deno.json` file! That's a great step.

Since I can't directly access files from your local file system, please **share the content of your `deno.json` file here**.

Once you provide the content, I can directly examine it to see:

1. **The `imports` configuration:** This is where we expect to find the mapping for `@utils/`.
2. **`compilerOptions`:** To ensure Deno's type-checking is configured appropriately.
3. Any other relevant settings.

With the actual `deno.json` content, we can quickly pinpoint why `@utils/types.ts` and `@utils/database.ts` are underlined in red and confirm if `npm:mongodb` resolution might be related to other configurations or simply an IDE cache issue.

\#prompt: Look into the deno.json file to determine why the imports in the wishlist concept are failing:
