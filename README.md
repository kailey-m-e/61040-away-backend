# Away Backend

**6.104 Assignment 4a: Backend Concept Coding**

## Overview

**Away** is a web application for users to document and share their past trips and future travel aspirations.

### Concepts

1. UserAuthentication
2. Posting
3. Wishlist
4. Friending

## File Structure

- **src/concepts**: contains a folder for each concept with:
    - an implementation file: [ConceptName]Concept.ts
    - a test script file: [ConceptName]Concept.test.ts
    - a test script console output file: [ConceptName]TestOutput.md
- **design**:
  - DesignRelection.md - design reflection & interesting moments
  - **/concepts**: contains a folder for each concept with:
    - a spec file: [ConceptName]ConceptSpec.md
    - a design reflection file: [ConceptName]DesignReflection.md
    - an LLM prompting file: [ConceptName]ConceptPrompts.md

## Note on LLM Use

For this assignment, I decided to mostly write the implementations and test cases by hand (in order to make sure I understood the process of creating a backend), and then I asked the LLM to review/critique my work and perform refactoring/supplemental code generation in some instances!
